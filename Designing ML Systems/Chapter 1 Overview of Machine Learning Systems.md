- One-shot learning: Classification using only a few training samples
- Zero shot learning: Learner observes samples from classes not in training, but still needs to predict the class they belong to. This is done by giving the learner some auxiliary info on classes

- Brand monitoring - sentiment analysis system
- Automated ticket classification

### Throughput vs latency
- Throughput: how many queries are processed within a specific time
- Latency: time it takes from receiving a query to returning the result
	- Duration that a request is waiting to be handled 


- **ML algorithms donâ€™t predict the future, but encode the past**

### Separations of concerns
- Design principle for separating a computer program into different sections 
- Modular programming: separating the functionality of a program into independent modules such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of functionality
