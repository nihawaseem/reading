### About

Organizing reading notes. Consolidating material from different sources. 

Currently the structure is:
  - Parent folder [source] e.g. textbook
  - Data folder within parent folder containing images and other data referenced in notes
  - Notes

Would prefer to pivot from a source-based structure to a topic based structure as time goes on.
