## Chapter 4 - Judgemental forecasts

- Settings in which judgmental forecasting is used:
    - there are no available data, so that statistical methods are not applicable and judgmental forecasting is the only feasible approach
    - data are available, statistical forecasts are generated, and these are then adjusted using judgment
    - data are available and statistical and judgmental forecasts are generated independently and then combined
- Anchoring in judgemental forecasts: subsequent forecasts tend to converge or be close to an initial familiar reference point

### Principles of judgemental forecasts

1. **Set the forecasting task clearly and concisely**
2. I**mplement a systematic approach**
3. Document the decision rules and assumptions implemented in the systematic approach
4. Systematically monitoring the forecasting process
5. **Segregate forecasters and users**
    - Target setting and adjustments should be made independent of the forecasting process

### The Delphi method

- The method relies on the key assumption that forecasts from a group are generally more accurate than those from individuals
- Constructs consensus forecasts from a group of experts in a structured iterative manner

**Method**

1. A panel of anonymous experts is assembled.
2. Forecasting tasks/challenges are set and distributed to the experts.
3. Experts return initial forecasts and justifications. These are compiled and summarised in order to provide feedback.
4. Feedback is provided to the experts, who now review their forecasts in light of the feedback. This step may be iterated until a satisfactory level of consensus is reached.
5. Final forecasts are constructed by aggregating the experts’ forecasts.

### Forecasting by analogy

- E.g. An appraiser estimates the market value of a house by comparing it to similar properties that have sold in the area. The degree of similarity depends on the attributes considered. With house appraisals, attributes such as land size, dwelling size, numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms, and garage space are usually considered
- We should aspire to base forecasts on multiple analogies rather than a single analogy, which may create biases
- We should aspire to consider multiple attributes
- Developing a detailed scoring mechanism to rank attributes and record the process of ranking will always be useful

### Judgemental adjustments

- Use adjustments sparingly
- Should not aim to correct for a systematic pattern in the data that is thought to have been missed by the statistical model — forecasters tend to read non-existent patterns in noisy series
- We should only adjust when we have important extra information which is not incorporated in the statistical model
