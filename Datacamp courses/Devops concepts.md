- Products released in cycles 
	- 1st product - minimum viable product 
	- If its good - improve, if its bad - drop or revamp 

- DataOps and MLOps 

#### Project management for DevOps
- Waterfall - linear sequence of events
- Agile - series of cycles 
	- **Scrum:** 2-4 week timeframe with a light development goal for the team
	- **Kanban:** Continuously flow 

#### DevOps change management model
New product
- Product engineers: design customer experience
- Infra engineers: design the parts that product engineers will use
- Data engineers: design data pipelines for new product 

#### Software architecture systems 
- APIs are how softwares send and receive data 
- Most software is about how data is sent between systems 
- **Microservices architecture** 
	- Instead of having a software as a single gigantic unit have small software applications separate from each other
	- Communicate via APIs 

#### Principles of CI
1. Version control
2. Frequent integration
3. Main branch - source-of-truth for database
4. Changes in alternative branch merged to main branch 

#### Principles of CD
1. Automated builds 
2. Automated tests - ensure build and test times are short 

#### Experimentation and feedback loops
- Experiment with subset of users
- Feedback loop - continuously improve product 

#### Data engineering implications of the DevOps architecture
- Monolithic vs microservice
