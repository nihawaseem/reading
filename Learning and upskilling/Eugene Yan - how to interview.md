**Hunger** shows up as having bias for action, being able to learn fast, and the grit to push through challenges. In startups, this helps candidates adapt quickly as the startup iterates toward product-market fit. In larger organizations, this helps new hires push through technical and organizational challenges that might discourage others.

IMHO hunger is more hired than coached. While budget and time constraints can simulate urgency, it’s a poor substitute for the intrinsic drive that gets shit done.

**Judgement** is the hard-won intuition to distinguish between what will work and what’s a wild goose chase or dead end. Judgment helps one make pragmatic decisions, think several steps ahead, and be decisive in the face of uncertainty. In the context of ML, this could be making a design decision to focus on techniques that work well with sparse data for cold-start recommendations, or deciding not to focus on chat for LLM-powered products.

While judgment can be cultivated, it takes time. The impact of design decisions may only become apparent after 12 - 18 months. Thus, for roles that need good judgment, it may be easier to hire for a track record of good decisions than to develop it on the job.

**Empathy** is the genuine interest in customers, the organization, and the team. This may show up as passion for the mission/product and how it helps customers. Empathy makes it easier to build trust, empower others, and foster productive relationships. People with empathy are also better communicators because they [“seek first to understand, then to be understood”](https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-5/). This is especially crucial for senior roles who may have to influence without authority, navigate delicate organization challenges, and moderate hotly debated topics.

Empathy is likely innate and thus mostly hired. While there are techniques to demonstrate empathy, they’re superficial if there isn’t a sincere interest in others and their challenges.
