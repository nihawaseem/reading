- raise can also be used to raise errors 

### Logging
- recording what your code has done in a separate file while it runs
- use python logging module
- use timestamps and log errors as well

### Debugging
- save a copy of whatever caused the error, whether this is the inputs to your function or the results of a particular database query
- Debuggers 
	- use breakpoints: points you select where you want to pause code execution and inspect the state of some variable, or a saved file in a database
	- add breakpoint() to your code
